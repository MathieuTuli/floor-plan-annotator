# Sortal Based Shape Grammars
## This is an unofficial repository and adaption for [Sortal](http://www.sortal.org/index.html).

Sortal is a python library used for creating shape grammars, amongst a few other things. If you really want to know more about it, go to the link listed above. It augments that code in the following ways:
- Allows you to `pip install` the library (See XXX)
- Allows for labelled vertices and edges, and thus also allows you to write rules for labelled vertices and edges
- Implements a shape tree datastructure
  - the shape tree datastructure allows for the organization of shapes generated by the system
  - a new shape is simply children of the previous ones in the tree, the result of applying rules. This allows for a full revisional history of the shapes you generate
- Cleans the code following PEP8 standards
